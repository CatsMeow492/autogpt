# Outcome Quality
Extremely low quality. The AI was unable to produce a resume that was even remotely close to the quality of my old resume.

# Narrative

The output was mostly nonsensicle. The AI spent a lot of time researching how to 
write a resume for a software developer but took almost none of the advice it found. In later prompt iteration I tried forcing it to write summaries of 
it's findings and then use those summaries to write a new resume, but it still
completely ignored it's own research. Resulting in a dramatically worse resume
than even a simple GPT4 model could produce with a copy/paste of my old resume.
