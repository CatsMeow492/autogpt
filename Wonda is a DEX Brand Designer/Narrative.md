# Outcome Quality

Relatively High Quality

# Narrative

I assumed with such a vague objective the program would be likely to succumb to the decision paralysis it usually suffers when given research tasks. However, it remained relatively focused. Giving concrete suggestions on a color pallette to use and specific ideas for logos with some Dalle generated images. Although I wouldn't call it a perfect result the prompt actually generated some useful assets.
