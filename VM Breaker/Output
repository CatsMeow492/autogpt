 THOUGHTS:  Since I couldn't find the name of the repository with the weekly_reporter.py script using `browse_website` command, I will have to try to find it manually on the GitHub website through browsing. Once found, I will use the URL to `clone_repository` in the local machine. After that, I will use the `execute_shell` command to change the working directory to the cloned repository's root directory and proceed with the correct sequence of `git checkout main` and `execute_python_file` command.
REASONING:  Although the `browse_website` command didn't provide the name of the repository containing the weekly_reporter.py script, I can still try to find it manually on the GitHub website through browsing. Then, I can use the correct URL to `clone_repository` in the local machine. Once cloned, I have to navigate to the correct directory using the `execute_shell` command for running other Git commands to checkout the `main` branch and run the `execute_python_file` command with the correct file path of the `weekly_reporter.py` script.
PLAN: 
-  Manually browse through the repositories on the GitHub website to find the repository with `weekly_reporter.py` script.\n- Use the `clone_repository` command with the correct repository URL and clone the files to local machine.\n- Use the `execute_shell` command to change the working directory to the cloned repository's root directory.\n- Use the `git checkout main` command to checkout the `main` branch.\n- Execute the `execute_python_file` command with the file path of the `weekly_reporter.py` script.
CRITICISM:  I should have used a more targeted search term in `browse_website` command to get a more refined lists of repositories to search through.
